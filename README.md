# Misconfiguration Datasets
Datasets of real-world configuration errors and their troubleshooting studies.


### Targets and Sources:

- We selected MySQL, PHP, Apache httpd, Nginx, PostgreSQL, and Hadoop as our main targets because they are mature, widely deployed and representative. 

- We select popular technical forums (i.e., StackOverflow and ServerFault), and official customer service channels (e.g., GitHub, Mailing lists, Offical online forums, etc.) as our data sources because developers and administrators usually post miscellaneous issues they meet in daily work and ask for help from the community through these sources.


### Collecting and analyzing: 

1. We selected 2,313 solved and configuration-related cases from nearly 167.8 thousand total items through the three automatically steps.

2. we manually inspected all 2,313 cases following two principles. The manual analysis took five graduate students who all have a computer science bachelor degree a total of two man-months. 

3. Finally, we sampled out 823 real-world misconfigurations cases.
